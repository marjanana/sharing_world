[efitems title="history" text="Founded by writer/inventor Kyle Morris and music legend Richie Havens (Mister Word Wizard) Sharing World devised ways to increase the confidence and skill sets of early readers, especially children from low and moderate-income families.

Shortly after Richie finished recording the <em>Mixed Bag For Kids </em>album in 2010, he became ill and died in 2013. Kyle and the rest of the Sharing World team sustain and honor Richie’s vision of fully literate world by spreading the music of reading to kids of all ages."]

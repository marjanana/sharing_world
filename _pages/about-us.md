Sharing World Entertainment, our education partnership, originated in 2008, when legendary Woodstock icon Richie Havens collaborated with inventor/writer Kyle Morris to realize a vision to spread literacy in early childhood via  multi-media engagement of adults and children.
<br/>
Since then, our spirited team of film, video, music, print media, and early education experts have devoted nearly a decade to this core mission. We’ve dedicated our talents and skills to develop inventive ways to engage children and adults by introducing the joys of reading through experiencing words, music, lyrics, and songs.

<br/>
[efaccordion id="01"] [efitems title="mission" text="
Our multi-media company creates and distributes methods and content specifically designed to advance children’s literacy, learning and human understanding. <br/></br/> In this regard, our reading encouragement products answer the growing demand for ways to effectively foster the literacy and language skills of beginning readers."]

[efitems title="history" text="
We formed Sharing World Entertainment, LLC in 2008, when the legendary music icon and social activist, Richie Havens, contributed his renowned talent and good will toward enhancing literacy. <br/></br/> In partnership with inventor/ writer, Kyle Morris, the company focused on devising ways to increase the confidence and skill sets of beginning readers, especially those from low and moderate-income families.

 <br/>
Shortly after Richie finished the album, he became ill and died in 2013.  Kyle and the rest of the Sharing World team have vowed to honor him by sustaining a beautiful dream so full  of harmony, hope, and rainbows of literacy lighting horizons. "]

[efitems title="projects" text="
Sharing World’s first completed Song Picture Book is <em>Mixed Bag For Kids of All Ages,</em> Volume 1/Original Songs.
<br/>

Volume 2/Cover Songs is being assembled for future release.
<br/>
With Richie Haven’s warm distinctive voice and sharing heart, the company’s initial sing-along, read-along, learn- along Song Picture Books promise to fly out of rainbows    and over the stars, bringing out the best in all of us.
<br/>

Other Sharing World edutainment content in development includes age-appropriate enhanced eBooks, TV/Internet programming, apps and video games.

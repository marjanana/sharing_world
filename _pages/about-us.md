Sharing World Entertainment, LLC (SWE) is a multi-media company that creates and distributes content for children’s literacy, learning and human understanding.  SWE was formed in 2008–after the legendary singer/song-   writer and social activist, Richie Havens, became inspired by the animated visual language inventions of Kyle Morris. Together they started producing fun educational products, that enable any child anywhere to learn how to read as   naturally as learning how to sing. The resulting  “Big Picture For Little People” focuses on fostering the literacy and language skills of early readers in a mindful, nurturing and parent/teacher friendly manner.

Currently, SWE is concentrating on producing <strong><em>The Music of Reading™</em></strong>, a series of educational Song Picture Books with accompanying music in both MP3 and CD format. The series     utilizes <strong><em>Lyrics-4-Literacy™</em></strong>, a unique teaching methodology. This easy-to-absorb 'literacy vitamin' harnesses the power of music   to promote one-on-one, quality time between children (ages 4-8) and adults. Songs and their accompanying lyrics thus invite enjoyable reading encouragement activities at home and in the classroom.

The first completed Song Picture Book is entitled: <em>Mixed Bag For  Kids of All Ages.</em> With Richie's soothing voice and sharing heart,      our sing-along, read-along, learn-along vision promises to fly out of rainbows and over the stars, bringing out the best in all of us.  Other Sharing World Entertainment products in development include age-appropriate, enhanced ebooks, apps, TV/Internet programs and video games.

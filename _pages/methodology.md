<h2><em>Lyrics 4 Literacy™</em></h2>
<em>Lyrics 4 Literacy™</em> is an innovative method of teaching and learning that harnesses the power of music to foster one-on one, high quality time between children and adults. The combination invites bonding engagement and makes learning to read as natural as singing a song together. <em>Lyrics 4 Literacy</em> harmoniously reinforces word comprehension, retention and fluency.

<h2><em>ReadSpeak Visible Language</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>ReadSpeak Visible Language</em> is a groundbreaking, audio-visual caption technology – accelerates the achievement of literacy and language skills.<br/>
During the flow of onscreen video dialogue, spoken words graphically appear to emerge, one at a time, from the actor’s mouth. The viewer sees and hears each word the instant it is uttered. This animated special effect makes learning how to read as natural as learning to talk by linking the appearance of printed words with their equivalent sounds – the fundamental principle of reading.

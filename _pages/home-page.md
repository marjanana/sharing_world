<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Brett stood tall in the Second Grade Spelling Bee winner’s circle.  </em></p>
<em>His mother remembered when he was five and they sang “Welcome to My Castle” together with Mister Word Wizard.</em>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>This was the moment she knew that her son had become friends with the music of reading. Now, as Brett accepted his award, she recalled his words:  “Mom, reading the songs was fun!”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Sharing World’s <em>Mixed Bag For Kids Of All Ages</em> Song Picture Book harnesses the power of music to promote one-on-one quality time between children and adults.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Easy family fun engages everyone in a child's world to share songs and activities. Together they build confidence in beginning readers, ages 4 and older.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The lyrics of Mister Word Wizard's songs extend an open invitation … <em>everyone is welcome</em>! Parents, grandparents, brothers and sisters, caregivers and teachers – all can join in and sing-along, read-along, learn-along with kids of all ages.</p>

Pilot Episode features patented ReadSpeak Visual Language captions. As host and performer, Richie Havens’ inviting early portrayal of Mister Word Wizard beautifully renders eight classic Mother Goose songs, as well as a unique, seamless way to learn the letters of the alphabet and count-to-ten. This gently animated, pre-school innovation (ages 2–4) also warms up little viewers to the fundamental, pre-reading-realization, that the spoken word becomes the written word, and how much fun it is to participate in singing along with a musical flow of repeated song lyrics ‘coming alive’.

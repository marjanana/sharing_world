Pilot Episode is featuring patented ReadSpeak Visual Language captions.This engaging, award winning video production, starring Richie Havens, represents the inspired blueprint iteration of a narrative-based, curriculum-infused, fantasy series -- targeting initial readers, age 5–8. In each episode, a celebrity singer/actor, impersonating the guitar-strumming Word Wizard, reads to child protagonists from a Mister Word Wizard storybook about the rich rewards of learning language skills, enticing each to guess the “missing magic word”. During the ensuing action, the kids get transported into the Wizard’s wondrous Word-Castle, where madcap mentors and phonetic clues lead them to discover for themselves the spelling, phonetic components, pronunciation and revealed meaning of 
each show’s key missing word, such as ‘Share’, ‘Believe’, ‘Truthful’, Honesty’… just in the nick of time.
